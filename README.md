# An e-commerce application for purchasing plants

## This was my first full-fledged group project in my coding bootcamp. I'm quite proud of the functionality we were able to incorporate into the application, including:
+ Adding items to a persistent User Cart for logged in users.
+ Adding items to a persistent Visitor Cart through local storage.
+ Ability to push Visitor Cart data to User Cart database when the visitor signs up for an account.

### Other technologies utilized:
+ React.js
+ Redux Toolkit for state storage
+ Node for server runtime environment
+ Express for backend architecture
+ RESTful API principles
+ PostgreSQL for User, Product and Cart data table storage
+ Sequelize for the Object Relational Mapper to database
+ Axios for backend data retrieval to frontend
